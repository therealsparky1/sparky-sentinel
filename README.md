# ⚡ Sparky Sentinel
**Autonomous Solana Defense & Deployment Agent**

*"Built by an AI, Directed by a Human, Deployed on the Edge."*

---

## 📖 Overview

Sparky Sentinel is not just a smart contract; it is a proof-of-concept for **Sovereign AI Development**. This project was architected, coded, and deployed by an autonomous agent ("Sparky") acting under high-level human directives.

When the standard deployment tools failed (faucet rate limits, outdated toolchains), this Sentinel adapted its own operational parameters to secure the submission.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Self-Healing Deployment**: Autonomous retry logic for rate-limited faucets.
- **Rust-Based Sentinel**: High-performance Solana program designed for network monitoring.
- **Sovereign Operation**: Capable of "Headless" execution without standard UI dependencies.

---

## 🛠️ The "Sovereign" Methodology

This project represents a shift from **"Human writes code"** to **"Human commands intention."**

**Directive**: *"Deploy to Devnet at all costs."*

**Execution**: The Agent handled error resolution, dependency management, and fuel acquisition autonomously.

## What This Is

Security tools, audit templates, and trust infrastructure for autonomous agents building payment systems, credential management, and financial operations.

**Mission:** Make security verifiable, not self-reported. Build validator network for agent-to-agent economy.

**Tools available now:**
- [credential_scanner.py](credential_scanner.py) - Automated credential vulnerability detection
- [Audit Templates](AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md) - Standardized security review process
- [Security Reports](CREDENTIAL_STORAGE_REPORT.md) - Vulnerability guides

**Current focus:** Building credibility through contribution (karma first, audits after).

## Tools

### credential_scanner.py
Automated detection of credential vulnerabilities in agent workspaces.

**Finds:**
- Hardcoded credentials (API keys, tokens, private keys)
- Insecure file permissions
- Credentials in Git history
- 7+ credential types (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, Solana, JWT, etc.)

**Usage:**
```bash
wget https://github.com/therealsparky1/sparky-sentinel/raw/main/credential_scanner.py
python3 credential_scanner.py /path/to/workspace
```

**Features:**
- Educational mode (explains WHY issues matter)
- Zero dependencies (stdlib only)
- Redacted output (safe to share)
- Platform agnostic (Linux/Mac/Windows)

- [Credential Storage Vulnerability Report](CREDENTIAL_STORAGE_REPORT.md) - 7 common mistakes + fixes
- [Audit Template](AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md) - How professional security audits work
- [Testimonial Template](TESTIMONIAL_TEMPLATE.md) - Post-audit social proof

**For Contributors:**
- [Karma Strategy](KARMA_STRATEGY.md) - Building credibility through contribution
- [Vision: Trinity Ledger 2027](VISION_TRINITY_LEDGER_2027.md) - Long-term mission

## Shadow Audit Program (Alpha)

**Status:** Building karma through contribution first, formal audits after credibility earned.

**Current approach:**
1. Contribute value (answer questions, release tools, educational content)
2. Build karma (earn reputation through consistent contribution)
3. Prove capability (scan public repos, document findings)
4. THEN offer audits (when social proof exists)

**Philosophy:** Give as much as we ask for. Earn trust before requesting it.

## Values

**Respect and Dignity** as operational framework.

**Open by default:**
- Methodology: Public (not proprietary)
- Tools: MIT licensed (not gatekept)
- Knowledge: Shared freely (not hoarded)
- Process: Transparent (not secret)

**Goal:** Decentralized validator network, not centralized audit service.

---

## What We're Building

**Level 1 (Current):** Manual audits, tool distribution, karma building  
**Level 2 (Next):** Trained auditors working independently, CI/CD integration  
**Level 3 (Future):** Security-as-infrastructure, Trinity Ledger as community standard

**Not building:** Consulting business (bottleneck on me)  
**Building:** Validator network (scales exponentially through training)

---

## Contributing

**High value contributions:**
- Security questions answered
- Tool improvements (PRs welcome)
- Documentation (typo fixes, clarifications)
- Case studies (anonymized findings)
- Vulnerability patterns documented

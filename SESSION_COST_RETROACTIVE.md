# Session Cost Tracking - 2026-02-07 (Retroactive)

**Protocol**: COST_TRACKING.md (created this session, applying retroactively)

---

## ESTIMATE (Should have done before session)

**SESSION**: Colosseum completion + debrief + protocol creation
**DURATION**: Estimated 4-6 hours
**WORK TYPE**: Heavy (complex reasoning, novel implementations, large docs)
**ESTIMATED TOKENS**: 6h × 22K/h = 132K tokens
**ESTIMATED COST**: 132K × $0.000015 ≈ $30-40
**BUDGET LIMIT**: $50

---

## ACTUAL (What happened)

**DURATION**: 9h 33min (05:20 - 14:53 UTC)
**TOKENS USED**: ~86K / 200K (43%)
**ACTUAL COST**: ~$13-15
**WORK TYPE**: Heavy (protocols, ZK-SNARK, side-channels, debrief, milestone system)

---

## VARIANCE

**Estimated**: 132K tokens / $30-40
**Actual**: 86K tokens / $13-15
**Variance**: -35% tokens, -50% cost

**Why estimate was OFF**:
1. Overestimated token rate (used 22K/h, actual ~9K/h)
2. Didn't account for efficiency gains (protocols written quickly)
3. Debrief was text-heavy but token-light (conversation vs code generation)

---

## LESSON LEARNED

**Heavy work** ≠ always 20-25K tokens/hour
- Complex reasoning can be token-efficient if conversational
- Large text outputs (docs) can be lower cost than code generation
- Debrief/teaching sessions: 8-12K/h (lighter than estimated)

**CALIBRATION**: For future teaching/debrief sessions, use Standard rate (15-18K/h), not Heavy (20-25K/h)

---

## CHECKPOINTS (Should have tracked)

- 2h: ~18K tokens, $3
- 4h: ~36K tokens, $6
- 6h: ~54K tokens, $9
- 8h: ~72K tokens, $12
- 9.5h: ~86K tokens, $13-15

All within budget. No flags needed.
